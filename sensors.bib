abstract = {In the last 15 years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer hardware and software is now available and can support the complex high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled are now able to live for many years and even those with severely limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic means of communication and control because of the recent advances in the technology, research, and applications of BCI. This book is intended to provide an introduction to and summary of essentially all major aspects of BCI research and development. Its goal is to be a comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated presentation of the field's key principles, current practice, and future prospects.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast, non-parametric nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01).},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the support of attentional and memory processes in controlling a P300-based brain-computer interface (BCI) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Eight people with ALS performed two behavioral tasks: (i) a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, screening the temporal filtering capacity and the speed of the update of the attentive filter, and (ii) a change detection task, screening the memory capacity and the spatial filtering capacity. The participants were also asked to perform a P300-based BCI spelling task. By using correlation and regression analyses, we found that only the temporal filtering capacity in the RSVP task was a predictor of both the P300-based BCI accuracy and of the amplitude of the P300 elicited performing the BCI task. We concluded that the ability to keep the attentional filter active during the selection of a target influences performance in BCI control.},

abstract = {An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N = 81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%} (N = 38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8 h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Nowadays, strokes are a growing cause of mortality and many people remain with motor sequelae and troubles in the daily activities. To treat this sequelae, alternative rehabilitation techniques are needed. In this article a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system to control a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system is presented. It can be used as a novel tool in easy setup clinical routines, to improve the rehabilitation process by mean of detecting patient´s motor intention, performing it by FES and finally receiving appropriate feedback The BCI-FES system presented here, consists of three blocks: the first one decodes the patient´s intention and it is composed by the patient, the acquisition hardware and the processing software (Emotiv EPOC{\textregistered}). The second block, based on Arduino's technology, transforms the information into a valid command signal. The last one excites the patient´s neuromuscular system by means of a FES device. In order to evaluate the cerebral activity sensed by the device, topographic maps were obtained. The BCI-FES system was able to detect the patient´s motor intention and control the FES device. At the time of this publication, the system it's being employing in a rehabilitation program with patients post stroke.},

We selected two women (who were breastfeeding), one without and one with breast engorgement. Then, we compare the different patterns of engorgement, temperature and tolerance to painful pressure before and after treatment, which consisted of massage and manual milking. Initial measurements indicated that normal puerperal breasts were cooler than ingurgitated breasts; also it was found that the normal breasts were more tolerant to pain pressure. After treatment, the engorged breasts have their temperature reduced and also represented more tolerance to pain. The technologies applied, although with some limitations, have provided preliminary important information, which combined with the clinical examination showed different patterns of breast engorgement, temperature and tolerance to pain, comparing the events before and after treatment.},

abstract = {"This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded; however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording, laboratories have collected new and different "technical artifacts." We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients' conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients' outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic function during critical periods of operations, again with a time course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful time frame"-Provided by publisher.},

We approach this problem by calculating the frequency of both healthy and epileptic EEG signals, and we find that all EEG signals obey the Gaussian distribution with different standard deviations. However, under some transformation, we can treat EEG signals as PRNGs. Our transformation takes the sum of the least significant five bits of the EEG sample amplitude and then outputs the parity of this sum to a binary (0 or 1) sequence. Our binary sequences have passed nearly all NIST pseudo-random number tests except a few failures. This indicates that the EEG signals can indeed become a PRNG provided that it undergoes a transformation like ours. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to describe a P300 by a shape-feature vector, which offers several advantages over the feature vector used by the BCI2000 system. Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 . Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the world. Symptoms include progressive memory, cognitive and behavioural changes before death, caused by amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorated tau in the brain. The cause of AD is currently unknown and current interventions only slow the decline. Diagnosis is based on patient and familial history, interviews with close family and friends, cognitive, mental and physical tests. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the electrical signals of the brain, which AD, as a cortical dementia, is known to directly affect. Non-linear signal processing has shown that these changes in the EEG can be identified with complementary findings to linear methods. This thesis aimed to explore these changes with novel univariate and bivariate methods using both synthetic signals and resting, eyes-closed EEGs recorded from 22 subjects, 11 AD patients (MMSE=13.1±5.9 (mean SD)) and 11 age-matched controls (30±0). Permutation entropy showed statistically significant increased complexity in control EEGs for electrodes at the front of the head. Bivariate analysis was novel for this EEG database so coherence was used to create a comparison results set. With the success of Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), distance based bivariate forms were applied (dLZC03). Novel normalisation methods based on that for univariate LZC showed a greater representation of the signal patterns in the results. Volume conduction was shown to significantly impact the results, both of coherence and dLZC03, though this was greater with coherence. Lastly, volume conduction mitigated, bandwidth based pre filtering with dLZC03 was calculated, producing the most significant p values ever recorded with this EEG database. Thus this PhD shows increased distinction between the two subject groups with dLZC03 over LZC and increased distinction with limited but targeted bandwidths from those subject signals.},

abstract = {Patterns of neural data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) can be classified by machine learning techniques to increase human-system performance. In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50{\%} when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.},

abstract = {We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (TMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (???4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are important research tools because they provide insights into mental processing at high temporal resolution. Their usefulness, however, is limited by the need to average over a large number of trials, sacrificing information about the trial-by-trial variability of latencies or amplitudes of specific ERP components. Here we propose a novel method based on an iteration strategy of the residues of averaged ERPs (RIDE) to separate latency-variable component clusters. The separated component clusters can then serve as templates to estimate latencies in single trials with high precision. By applying RIDE to data from a face-priming experiment, we separate priming effects and show that they are robust against latency shifts and within-condition variability. RIDE is useful for a variety of data sets that show different degrees of variability and temporal overlap between ERP components.},

By relative, we refer to the fact that this new measure is highly dependent on the decomposition dictionary used by MP. The structural part of the definition points to the fact that this new measure is related to the structure, or composition, of the signal under analysis. After a formal definition, the proposed RSC measure is used in the analysis of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, firstly, a time-frequency decomposition dictionary is specifically designed to compactly represent the newborn EEG seizure state using MP. We then show, through the analysis of synthetic and real newborn EEG data, that the relative structural complexity measure can indicate changes in EEG structure as it transitions between the two EEG states; namely seizure and background (non-seizure).},

Electroencephalography (EEG) still remains one of the most useful and effective tools in understanding and treatment of epilepsy. To this end, many computational methods have been devel-oped for both the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. Techniques derived from linear/nonlinear analysis, chaos, information theory, morphological analysis, model-based analysis, all present different advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Recently, there is the notion of selecting and combining the most robust features from different methods for revealing various signals' characteristics and making more reliable assumptions. Finally, intelligent classifiers are employed in order to distinguish epileptic state out of normal states. This chapter reviews the most widely adopted algorithms for the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures, emphasizing on information theory based and entropy indices. Each method's accuracy has been evaluated through performance measures, assessing the ability of automatic seizure detection/ prediction.},

abstract = {Objective: Designing a reliable and accurate brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the most challenging fields in biomedical signal processing. To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems' design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: "peak picking" and "template matching". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines. This research indicates that, using both spatial and temporal information content of EEG trials (from all electrodes or a subset of them), even under a non-complicated mathematical framework can yield an accurate and powerful classification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this article we propose a new method to reliably estimate single-trial amplitude and latency of EEG/MEG signals. The advantages of the method are fourfold. First, no a-priori specified template function is required. Second, the method allows for multiple signals that may vary independently in amplitude and/or latency. Third, the method is less sensitive to noise as it models data with a parsimonious set of basis functions. Finally, the method is very fast since it is based on an iterative linear least squares algorithm. A simulation study shows that the method yields reliable estimates under different levels of latency variation and signal-to-noise ratio{\~{O}}s. Furthermore, it shows that the existence of multiple signals can be correctly determined. An application to empirical data from a choice reaction time study indicates that the method describes these data accurately.},

In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

abstract = { The aim of this article is to compute reliable templates of event-related potentials (ERPs) for homogeneous groups of subjects and to automatically quantify the morphological characteristics of the ERPs. We developed a method based on dynamic time warping (DTW). The method was applied to ERPs recorded from normal and dyslexic children during two reading tasks. We found that characteristic latency and amplitude changes of ERP components are due to task and pathology. Our results support the idea that dyslexia involves different and complex cerebral functions aside from the language system. This mathematical approach provides reproducible analysis criteria that are crucial for the reliability of ERP analysis.},

@article{ChandranKS2016,
abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

abstract = {This study investigated the validity of procedures for estimating the P3 complex in single trials. In "pseudo-real" simulations of the N1-P2 complex of the occipital visual-evoked potential, M{\"{o}}cks, K{\"{o}}hler, Gasser, and Pham (1988) had reported that their maximum-likelihood method (Pham, M{\"{o}}cks, K{\"{o}}hler, {\&} Gasser, 1987) performed better than Woody's (1967) method. Using pseudo-real simulations of auditory oddball data, we wanted to know whether this finding also held true for the P3 complex. The performance of three methods was studied: peak picking, Woody's method, and Pham et al.'s method (as well as an extension of this latter method). Performance of all methods critically depended on the signal-to-noise ratio. There was some advantage for the more sophisticated methods, particularly when signal-to-noise ratios were realistic. "Good" trials may be selected by all methods, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but this selection entails the risk of bias. Further research should investigate whether these conclusions also hold true when the P3 complex consists of more than one component.},

From single/multi-channel EEGs, the proposed method estimates the number of waveforms common across trials, their delays in individual trials, and all of the waveforms. After verifying the performance of this method by a number of simulation tests with artificial EEGs, we apply it to EEGs during a Go/NoGo task. This method can be used in general situations where the number and the delays of EEG waveforms common across trials are unknown. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Schmidtmann2013,
abstract = {The proportion of signal elements embedded in noise needed to detect a signal is a standard tool for investigating motion perception. This paradigm was applied to the shape domain to determine how local information is pooled into a global percept. Stimulus arrays consisted of oriented Gabor elements that sampled the circumference of concentric radial frequency (RF) patterns. Individual Gabors were oriented tangentially to the shape (signal) or randomly (noise). In different conditions, signal elements were located randomly within the entire array or constrained to fall along one of the concentric contours. Coherence thresholds were measured for RF patterns with various frequencies (number of corners) and amplitudes ("sharpness" of corners). Coherence thresholds (about 10{\%} = 15 elements) were lowest for circular shapes. Manipulating shape frequency or amplitude showed a range where thresholds remain unaffected (frequency ≤ RF4; amplitude ≤ 0.05). Increasing either parameter caused thresholds to rise. Compared to circles, thresholds increased by approximately four times for RF13 and five times for amplitudes of 0.3. Confining the signals to individual contours significantly reduced the number of elements needed to reach threshold (between 4 and 6), independent of the total number of elements on the contour or contour shape. Finally, adding external noise to the orientation of the elements had a greater effect on detection thresholds than adding noise to their position. These results provide evidence for a series of highly sensitive, shape-specific analysers which sum information globally but only from within specific annuli. These global mechanisms are tuned to position and orientation of local elements from which they pool information. The overall performance for arrays of elements can be explained by the sensitivity of multiple, independent concentric shape detectors rather than a single detector integrating information widely across space (e.g. Glass pattern detector).},

abstract = {We present a novel approach to describe a P300 by a shape-feature vector, which offers several advantages over the feature vector used by the BCI2000 system. Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 . Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.},
