abstract = {The concept of neuro-information systems (neuroIS) has emerged in the IS discipline recently. Since the neuroIS field?s genesis, several neuroIS papers have been published. Investigating empirical papers published in scientific journals and conference proceedings reveals that electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool. Thus, considering its relevance in contemporary research and the fact that it will also play a major role in future neuroIS research, we describe EEG from a layman?s perspective. Because previous EEG descriptions in the neuroIS literature have only scantily outlined theoretical and methodological aspects related to this tool, we urgently need a more thorough one. As such, we inform IS scholars about the fundamentals of EEG in a compact way and discuss EEG?s potential for IS research. Based on the knowledge base provided in this paper, IS researchers can make an informed decision about whether EEG could, or should, become part of their toolbox.},

abstract = {Event-related potentials (ERPs) have been used for decades to study perception, cognition, emotion, neurological and psychiatric disorders, and lifespan development. ERPs consist of multiple components and reflect a specific neurocognitive process. In the past, there was no single source that could be consulted to learn about all the major ERP components; learning about a single ERP component required reading dozens or even hundreds of separate journal articles and book chapters. The Oxford Handbook of Event-Related Potential Components fills this longstanding void with a detailed and comprehensive review of the major ERP components. Comprising 22 chapters by the field's founders and leading researchers, this volume offers extensive coverage of all relevant topics: -the fundamental nature of ERP components, including essential information about how ERP components are defined and isolated -individual components, such as the N170, P300, and ERN -groups of related components within specific research domains, such as language, emotion, and memory -ERP components in special populations, including children, the elderly, nonhuman primates, and patients with neurological disorders, affective disorders, and schizophrenia While undeniably broad in scope, these chapters are accessible to novices while remaining informative and engaging to experts. The Oxford Handbook of Event-Related Potential Components is a unique and valuable resource for students and researchers throughout the brain sciences.},

@article{Mak2012,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify electroencephalography (EEG) features that correlate with P300-based brain-computer interface (P300 BCI) performance in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Twenty people with ALS used a P300 BCI spelling application in copy-spelling mode. Three types of EEG features were found to be good predictors of P300 BCI performance: (1) the root-mean-square amplitude and (2) the negative peak amplitude of the event-related potential to target stimuli (target ERP) at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, and P4; and (3) EEG theta frequency (4.5-8 Hz) power at Fz, Cz, P3, Pz, P4, PO7, PO8 and Oz. A statistical prediction model that used a subset of these features accounted for {\textgreater}60{\%} of the variance in copy-spelling performance (p {\textless} 0.001, mean R(2) = 0.6175). The correlations reflected between-subject, rather than within-subject, effects. The results enhance understanding of performance differences among P300 BCI users. The predictors found in this study might help in: (1) identifying suitable candidates for long-term P300 BCI operation; (2) assessing performance online. Further work on within-subject effects needs to be done to establish whether P300 BCI user performance could be improved by optimizing one or more of these EEG features.},

Handbook of EEG Interpretation, the first illustrated, portable handbook to discuss all aspects of clinical neurophysiology, is an essential means of quick reference for anyone involved in EEG interpretation. Handbook of EEG Interpretation provides practical information on reading EEGs by juxtaposing actual EEGs with bullet points of critical information, making it an essential neurophysiology reference for use during bedside, OR, ER, and ICU EEG interpretation. At once more concise, illustrative, and portable than other texts on EEG, Handbook of EEG Interpretation fits in a labcoat pocket, providing immediate information for anyone involved in EEG interpretation. It is a useful tool for all residents, fellows, and clinicians in neurology as well as many internists, psychiatrists, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU staff, ER staff, EEG technologists, and nurses. The book's seven main sections cover normal, abnormal, and epileptiform EEG patterns, as well as seizures, patterns of special significance (e.g., stupor and coma), polysomnography, and neurophysiologic intraoperative monitoring.

@article{Berger2017,
abstract = {Permutation entropy (PeEn) is a complexity measure that originated from dynamical systems theory. Specifically engineered to be robustly applicable to real-world data, the quantity has since been utilised for a multitude of time series analysis tasks. In electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis, value changes of PeEn correlate with clinical observations, among them the onset of epileptic seizures or the loss of consciousness induced by anaesthetic agents. Regarding this field of application, the present work suggests a relation between PeEn-based complexity estimation and spectral methods of EEG analysis: for ordinal patterns of three consecutive samples, the PeEn of an epoch of EEG appears to approximate the centroid of its weighted power spectrum. To substantiate this proposition, a systematic approach based on redundancy reduction is introduced and applied to sleep and epileptic seizure EEG. The interrelation demonstrated may aid the interpretation of PeEn in EEG, and may increase its comparability with other techniques of EEG analysis.},

PE is a recently introduced measure which quantifies signal complexity by measuring the departure of a time series from a random one. More regular signals are characterized by lower PE values. Here, PE is utilized to characterize signals from electroencephalograms of 3 subjects performing 4 motor imagery tasks, which are then classified using a Support Vector Machine.

@article{Michel2012,
abstract = {Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered EEG with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the EEG with other brain imaging techniques, EEG is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of EEG is highly underestimated. Many combined EEG-fMRI studies use the EEG only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical EEG studies use the EEG still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the EEG is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, EEG primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as MEG measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, EEG can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The idea of calculating entropy based on permutation patterns (that is, permutations defined by the order relations among values of a time series) has received a lot of attention in the last years, especially for the understanding of complex and chaotic systems. Permutation entropy directly accounts for the temporal information contained in the time series; furthermore, it has the quality of simplicity, robustness and very low computational cost.

abstract = {Systematic reviews provide clinical practice recommendations that are based on evaluation of primary evidence. When systematic reviews with the same aims have different conclusions, it is difficult to ascertain which review reported the most credible and robust findings. This study examined five systematic reviews that have investigated the effectiveness of Pilates exercise in people with chronic low back pain. A four-stage process was used to interpret findings of the reviews. This process included comparison of research questions, included primary studies, and the level and quality of evidence of systematic reviews. Two independent reviewers assessed the level of evidence and the methodological quality of systematic reviews, using the National Health and Medical Research Council hierarchy of evidence, and the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews respectively. Any disagreements were resolved by a third researcher. A high level of consensus was achieved between the reviewers. Conflicting findings were reported by the five systematic reviews regarding the effectiveness of Pilates in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. Authors of the systematic reviews included primary studies that did not match their questions in relation to treatment or population characteristics. A total of ten primary studies were identified across five systematic reviews. Only two of the primary studies were included in all of the reviews due to different inclusion criteria relating to publication date and status, definition of Pilates, and methodological quality. The level of evidence of reviews was low due to the methodological design of the primary studies. The methodological quality of reviews varied. Those which conducted a meta-analysis obtained higher scores. There is inconclusive evidence that Pilates is effective in reducing pain and disability in people with chronic low back pain. This is due to the small number and poor methodological quality of primary studies. The Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews provides a useful method of appraising the methodological quality of systematic reviews. Individual item scores, however, should be examined in addition to total scores, so that significant methodological flaws of systematic reviews are not missed, and results are interpreted appropriately.

@article{Uchida1999,
abstract = {Zero-cross and zero-derivative period amplitude analysis (PAA) data were compared with power spectral analysis (PSA) data obtained with the fast Fourier transform in all-night sleep EEG from 10 subjects. Although PAA zero-cross-integrated amplitude showed good agreement with PSA power in 0.3-2 Hz, zero-cross analysis appears relatively ineffective in measuring 2-4 Hz and above waves. However, PAA zero-derivative measures of peak-trough amplitude correlated well with PSA power in 2-4 Hz. Thus, while PAA appears able to measure the entire EEG spectrum, the analytic technique should be changed from zero cross to zero derivative at about 2 Hz in human sleep EEG. PAA and PSA both demonstrate robust and interrelated across-night oscillations in three frequency bands: delta (0.3-4 Hz); sigma (12-16 Hz); and fast beta (20-40 Hz). The frequencies between delta and sigma, and between sigma and fast beta, did not show clear across-night oscillations using either method, and the two methods showed lower epoch-to-epoch agreement in these intermediate bands. The causes of this reduced agreement are not immediately clear, nor is it obvious which method gives more valid results. We believe that the three strongly oscillating frequency bands represent fundamental properties of the human sleep EEG that provide important clues to underlying physiological mechanisms. These mechanisms are more likely to be understood if their dynamic properties are preserved and measured naturalistically rather than being forced into arbitrary sleep stages or procrustean models. Both PAA and PSA can be employed for such naturalistic studies. PSA has the advantages of applying the same analytic method across the EEG spectrum and rests on more fully developed theory. Combined zero-cross and zero-derivative PAA demonstrates EEG oscillations that closely parallel those observed with spectral power, and the PAA measures do not rely on assumptions about the spectral composition of the signal. In addition, both PAA techniques can measure the relative contributions of wave amplitude and incidence to total power. These waveform characteristics represent different biological processes and respond differentially to a wide range of experimental conditions. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.},

We study its performance in simulated data as well as in visual and auditory ERPs. For the simulated data, the method gives a significantly better reconstruction of the single-trial event-related responses in comparison with the original data and also in comparison with a reconstruction based on conventional Wiener filtering. Moreover, with wavelet denoising we obtain a significantly better estimation of the amplitudes and latencies of the simulated ERPs. For the real data, the method clearly improves the visualization of both visual and auditory single-trial ERPs. This allows the calculation of better averages as well as the study of systematic or unsystematic variations between trials. Since the method is fast and parameter free, it could complement the conventional analysis of ERPs. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Wolpaw2002,
abstract = {For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world - a brain-computer interface (BCI). Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely paralyzed, or 'locked in', with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device. Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus, the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have maximum information transfer rates up to 10-25bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identification of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supplementary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances.},

However, publications that discuss relevant topics are written for divergent audiences with specific levels of expertise: explanations are either at an abstract level that leaves readers with a fuzzy understanding of the electrophysiology involved, or are at a technical level that requires mastery of the relevant physics to understand. A clear, comprehensive review of the origin and measurement of EEG that bridges these high and low levels of explanation fills a critical gap in the literature and is necessary for promoting better research practices and peer review. The present paper addresses the neurophysiological source of EEG, propagation of the EEG signal, technical aspects of EEG measurement, and implications for interpretation of EEG data.}

This work proposes a scheme for multichannel EEG acquisition systems based on SE amplifiers and a novel digital driven right leg (DDRL) circuit, which overcome the poor CMRR of the front-end stage providing a high common mode reduction at power line frequency (up to 80 dB). A functional prototype was built and tested showing the feasibility of the proposed technique.

@article{Lutz2008,
abstract = {The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world. Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account, the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88{\%}, somewhat higher than previously assessed. After mid-century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.},

abstract = {The history of quantitative, computerized electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis is reviewed. It is shown that, until very recently, the basic approach to EEG analysis involved the assumption that the EEG is stochastic. Consequently, statistical pattern recognition techniques, segmentation procedures, syntactic methods, knowledge-based approaches, and even artificial neural network methods have been developed with different levels of success. A fundamentally different approach to computerized EEG analysis, however, is making its way into the laboratories. The basic idea, inspired by recent advances in the area of non-linear dynamics, and especially the theory of chaos, is to view an EEG as the output of a deterministic system of relatively simple complexity, but containing non-linearities. This suggests that studying the geometrical dynamics of EEGs, and the development of neurophysiologically realistic models of EEG generation may produce more successful automated EEG analysis techniques than the classical, stochastic methods. Evidence supporting the non-linear dynamics paradigm is reviewed, and possible research paths are indicated. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

@article{Giagante2003,
abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical-electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns at seizure onset in patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Methods: Sixty-six ictal video-EEG recordings corresponding to 26 patients with HS have been reviewed, focusing on the EEG features found during the first 30 ictal s. The EEG activity has been classified into the following groups: (A) according to spatial distribution: type 1: temporal electrodes on one side; type 2: temporal and adjacent frontal electrodes on one side; and type 3: non-lateralizing electrographic activity; and (B) according to morphology; subtype (a): regular 5-9 Hz rhythmic activity (RA); subtype (b): low-voltage rapid activity, followed by a 5-9 Hz RA; and subtype (c): irregular EEG sharp waves. We analyzed the clinical symptoms sequence and established the relationship with the ictal EEG patterns. Results: Considering spatial distribution and morphology, the most frequent ictal EEG patterns were type 1 (57{\%}), type 2 (37{\%}), and subtype (a): 62{\%}; subtype (b): 27{\%}; and subtype (c): 11{\%}. The sequence of clinical symptoms observed was: aura→behavioral arrest→oro-alimentary automatisms→unilateral hand automatisms. All seizures with aura and including two or more symptoms of the clinical sequence (65{\%}) were associated with a 1a, 1b, 2a or 2b EEG pattern. Conclusions: The identification of a specific clinical-EEG pattern provides a useful tool for the epileptogenic zone localization in non-invasive pre-surgical assessment of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. Significance: The identification of a specific clinical-EEG pattern associated to neuroimaging findings and neuropsychological testing allows indicating surgery for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with hippocampal sclerosis, without performing any further complementary studies. {\textcopyright} 2003 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

@article{Thakor2004,
abstract = {entropy, complexity measure, information processing, fractal dimension applications I Abstract Quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) plays a significant role in EEG-based clinical diagnosis and studies of brain function. In past decades, various qEEG methods have been extensively studied. This article provides a detailed review of the advances in this field. qEEG methods are generally classified into linear and nonlinear approaches. The traditional qEEG approach is based on spectrum analysis, which hypothesizes that the EEG is a stationary process. EEG signals are nonstationary and nonlinear, especially in some pathological conditions. Various time-frequency representations and time-dependent measures have been proposed to address those transient and irregular events in EEG. With regard to the nonlinearity of EEG, higher order statistics and chaotic measures have been put forward. In characterizing the interactions across the cerebral cortex, an information theory-based measure such as mutual information is applied. To improve the spatial resolution, qEEG analysis has also been combined with medical imaging technology (e.g., CT, MR, and PET). With these advances, qEEG plays a very important role in basic research and clinical studies of brain injury, neurological disorders, epilepsy, sleep studies and consciousness, and brain function.},

While the promise of incredible technologies is real, caution must be taken as implications regarding optimal performance and unforeseen side effects following device implantation into the brain are not fully characterized. The current study is aimed to quantify any motor deficit caused by microelectrode implantation in the motor cortex of healthy rats compared to non-implanted controls. Following electrode insertion, rats were tested on an open-field grid test to study gross motor function and a ladder test to study fine motor function. It was discovered that rats with chronically indwelling intracortical microelectrodes exhibited up to an incredible 527{\%} increase in time to complete the fine motor task. This initial study defines the need for further and more robust behavioral testing of potential unintentional harm caused by microelectrode implantation.},

abstract = {Subsequent to global initiatives in mapping the human brain and investigations of neurobiological markers for brain disorders, the number of multi-site studies involving the collection and sharing of large volumes of brain data, including electroencephalography (EEG), has been increasing. Among the complexities of conducting multi-site studies and increasing the shelf life of biological data beyond the original study are timely standardization and documentation of relevant study parameters. We present the insights gained and guidelines established within the EEG working group of the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND). CAN-BIND is a multi-site, multi-investigator, and multi-project network supported by the Ontario Brain Institute with access to Brain-CODE, an informatics platform that hosts a multitude of biological data across a growing list of brain pathologies. We describe our approaches and insights on documenting and standardizing parameters across the study design, data collection, monitoring, analysis, integration, knowledge-translation, and data archiving phases of CAN-BIND projects. We introduce a custom-built EEG toolbox to track data preprocessing with open-access for the scientific community. We also evaluate the impact of variation in equipment setup on the accuracy of acquired data. Collectively, this work is intended to inspire establishing comprehensive and standardized guidelines for multi-site studies.},

@article{ChandranKS2016,
abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

abstract = {Background Epilepsy is a common neurological disease, and electroencephalogram (EEG) contains massive epilepsy information. Automatic recognition of epileptic discharges has great significance in diagnosis of epilepsy. New method This paper proposes a novel automatic recognition of epileptic waves method in EEG signals based on shape similarity in time-series sequence directly. Merger of the increasing and decreasing sequences (MIDS) was used to improve the recognition accuracy and reduce the computation cost. Then shape templates were designed, and the modified Hausdorff distance was employed to measure the shape similarity of waveforms in template matching part. This approach imitates human visual cognitive process to analyze EEG and employs image recognition method into one-dimensional signals, which is a direct, original and effective method. Results 373 epileptic discharge fragments marked by clinicians from 20 patients' EEG recordings were selected. By fusing significance rules, 98.39{\%} of them were recognized, with the false recognition rate 1.1{\%}. Comparison with existing methods Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach yielded better performance for interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDS) recognition compared with the previous methods. Conclusions The proposed approach has good performance and high stability in automatic recognition of epileptic discharges both in ictal and interictal period, which could support the diagnosis of epilepsy greatly.},

However, it is very difficult to get useful information from these signals directly in the time domain just by observing them. They are basically non-linear and nonstationary in nature. Hence, important features can be extracted for the diagnosis of different diseases using advanced signal processing techniques. In this paper the effect of different events on the EEG signal, and different signal processing methods used to extract the hidden information from the signal are discussed in detail.

Fujimori's method has been considered one of the most appropriate waveform analyses for EEG. This kind of analysis is advantageous for measuring frequency and amplitude of each EEG wave separately. However, current implementations have drawbacks which must be resolved before they can be used on all-night sleep EEG. An optimal sampling rate should be determined which is appropriate to the purpose of analysis. Amplitude thresholds for wave recognition, which are now set arbitrarily, should also be improved. Measurement of waves in higher orders of superimposition is also necessary, although existing systems are limited to the second order. Additional algorithms, such as for the separate detection of sleep slow waves, may be useful. Further applications for Fujimori's method are suggested.},

@article{Rodenbeck2006,
abstract = {Question of the study The reliable evaluation of polysomnographic recordings (PSG) is an essential precondition for good clinical practice in sleep medicine. Although the scoring rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales [86] are internationally well established, they leave some room for different interpretations, and this may contribute to the limited reliability of visual sleep scoring. The German Sleep Society (DGSM) has set up a task force to devise ways to improve scoring reliability in the framework of their quality management programme. The intention was not to revise the rules of Rechtschaffen and Kales (R{\&}K), but to facilitate their reliable application in sleep scoring and to support the development of standardized algorithms for computerized sleep analysis. Methods The task force was formed in September 2004 as a subcommittee of the educational panel of the DGSM. The members of the task force are experienced in sleep scoring and have a background either in physiology, neurology, psychiatry, psychology, or biology. The aim of the task force was to provide interpretation aids and, if needed, specifications or amendments to the R{\&}K rules for the scoring of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) waveforms and patterns. Decisions were based on the nominal group technique of a nominal panel as the formal consensus-building process. The consensus process was based on scoring and face-to-face discussions of at least 40 examples for each pattern in four 2-day meetings. Results Relevant EEG patterns for sleep stage scoring are alpha, theta, and delta waves, sleep spindles, K-complexes, vertex sharp waves, and sawtooth waves. If definitions for a given EEG pattern differed in the literature, the nominal group technique resulted in specifications and amended scoring rules for these EEG patterns. A second part including a series of examples with explanatory comments for each of these EEG patterns is under preparation. Conclusions Amendatory scoring rules of those EEG patterns that are relevant for sleep scoring may contribute to increasing the reliability of visual sleep scoring and to support the development of standardized algorithms for computerized sleep analysis.

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive electrophysiological methods, which record electric potentials and magnetic fields due to electric currents in synchronously-active neurons. With MEG being more sensitive to neural activity from tangential currents and EEG being able to detect both radial and tangential sources, the two methods are complementary. Over the years, neurophysiological studies have changed considerably: high-density recordings are becoming de rigueur; there is interest in both spontaneous and evoked activity; and sophisticated artifact detection and removal methods are available. Improved head models for source estimation have also increased the precision of the current estimates, particularly for EEG and combined EEG/MEG. Because of their complementarity, more investigators are beginning to perform simultaneous EEG/MEG studies to gain more complete information about neural activity. Given the increase in methodological complexity in EEG/MEG, it is important to gather data that are of high quality and that are as artifact free as possible. Here, we discuss some issues in data acquisition and analysis of EEG and MEG data. Practical considerations for different types of EEG and MEG studies are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper describes the development and testing of a system whereby one can communicate through a computer by using the P300 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP). Such a system may be used as a communication aid by individuals who cannot use any motor system for communication (e.g., 'locked-in' patients). The 26 letters of the alphabet, together with several other symbols and commands, are displayed on a computer screen which serves as the keyboard or prosthetic device. The subject focuses attention successively on the characters he wishes to communicate. The computer detects the chosen character on-line and in real time. This detection is achieved by repeatedly flashing rows and columns of the matrix. When the elements containing the chosen character are flashed, a P300 is elicited, and it is this P300 that is detected by the computer. We report an analysis of the operating characteristics of the system when used with normal volunteers, who took part in 2 experimental sessions. In the first session (the pilot study/training session) subjects attempted to spell a word and convey it to a voice synthesizer for production. In the second session (the analysis of the operating characteristics of the system) subjects were required simply to attend to individual letters of a word for a specific number of trials while data were recorded for off-line analysis. The analyses suggest that this communication channel can be operated accurately at the rate of 0.20 bits/sec. In other words, under the conditions we used, subjects can communicate 12.0 bits, or 2.3 characters, per min. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{Fulcher2014,
abstract = {A highly comparative, feature-based approach to time series classification is introduced that uses an extensive database of algorithms to extract thousands of interpretable features from time series. These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large datasets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the datasets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using Euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the dataset, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.},

@article{Nevado-Holgado2012,
abstract = {In this paper we propose that the dynamic evolution of EEG activity during epileptic seizures may be characterised as a path through parameter space of a neural mass model, reflecting gradual changes in underlying physiological mechanisms. Previous theoretical studies have shown how boundaries in parameter space of the model (so-called bifurcations) correspond to transitions in EEG waveforms between apparently normal, spike and wave and subsequently poly-spike and wave activity. In the present manuscript, we develop a multi-objective genetic algorithm that can estimate parameters of an underlying model from clinical data recordings. A standard approach to this problem is to transform both clinical data and model output into the frequency domain and then choose parameters that minimise the difference in their respective power spectra. Instead in the present manuscript, we estimate parameters in the time domain, their choice being determined according to the best fit obtained between the model output and specific features of the observed EEG waveform. This results in an approximate path through the bifurcation plane of the model obtained from clinical data. We present comparisons of such paths through parameter space from separate seizures from an individual subject, as well as between different subjects. Differences in the path reflect subtleties of variation in the dynamics of EEG, which at present appear indistinguishable using standard clinical techniques. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Acharya2013,
abstract = {Epilepsy is an electrophysiological disorder of the brain, characterized by recurrent seizures. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of the brain, and is widely used in the detection and analysis of epileptic seizures. However, it is often difficult to identify subtle but critical changes in the EEG waveform by visual inspection, thus opening up a vast research area for biomedical engineers to develop and implement several intelligent algorithms for the identification of such subtle changes. Moreover, the EEG signals are nonlinear and non-stationary in nature, which contribute to further complexities related to their manual interpretation and detection of normal and abnormal (interictal and ictal) activities. Hence, it is necessary to develop a Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system to automatically identify the normal and abnormal activities using minimum number of highly discriminating features in classifiers. It has been found that nonlinear features are able to capture the complex physiological phenomena such as abrupt transitions and chaotic behavior in the EEG signals. In this review, we discuss various feature extraction methods and the results of different automated epilepsy stage detection techniques in detail. We also briefly present the various open ended challenges that need to be addressed before a CAD based epilepsy detection system can be set-up in a clinical setting. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The research in this field has attracted academia and industry alike. The objective is to help severely disabled people to live their life as regular persons as much as possible. Some of these disabilities are categorized as neurological neuromuscular disorders. A BCI system goes through many phases including preprocessing, feature extraction, signal classifications, and finally control. Large body of research are found at each phase and this might confuse researchers and BCI developers. This article is a review to the state-of-the-art work in the field of BCI. The main focus of this review is on the Brain control signals, their types and classifications. In addition, this survey reviews the current BCI technology in terms of hardware and software where the most used BCI devices are described as well as the most utilized software platforms are explained. Finally, BCI challenges and future directions are stated. Due to the limited space and large body of literature in the field of BCI, another two review articles are planned. One of these articles reviews the up-to-date BCI algorithms and techniques for signal processing, feature extraction, signals classification, and control. Another article will be dedicated to BCI systems and applications. The three articles are written as base and guidelines for researchers and developers pursue the work in the field of BCI.},

Aiming at the fault feature of rolling bearing, a novel double-dictionary matching pursuit (DDMP) for fault extent evaluation of rolling bearing based on the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) index is proposed in this paper. In order to match the features of rolling bearing fault, the impulse time-frequency dictionary and modulation dictionary are constructed to form the double-dictionary by using the method of parameterized function model. Then a novel matching pursuit method is proposed based on the new double-dictionary. For rolling bearing vibration signals with different fault sizes, the signals are decomposed and reconstructed by the DDMP. After the noise reduced and signals reconstructed, the LZC index is introduced to realize the fault extent evaluation. The applications of this method to the fault experimental signals of bearing outer race and inner race with different degree of injury have shown that the proposed method can effectively realize the fault extent evaluation.},

abstract = {Population ageing is now recognised as a global issue of increasing importance, and has many implications for health care and other areas of social policy. However, these issues remain relatively under-researched, particularly in poorer countries, and there is a dearth of specific policy initiatives at the international level. For example, the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development agreed to 15 key principles for future policy, but none of these even make indirect mention of the aged (International Conference on Population and Development, 1995, Documents. Programme of action of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. Population and Development Review, 21(2), 437-461). This paper seeks to highlight some of the key issues arising from population ageing. It begins with a brief overview of international trends in demographic ageing, and considers the health needs of different groups of older people. It sketches out some implications for policy, paying particular attention to the financing and organisation of health services. The final part of the paper contains a discussion about how older people have been affected by, and have adapted to, processes of social, economic and political change. Given the wide scope of these concerns, it is not possible to discuss any issue in detail, and the paper does not claim to give the subject matter a comprehensive or global treatment. It must be stressed that patterns of ageing and their implications for policy are highly complex and variable, and, as such, great care should be taken in generalising between the experiences of different groups of older people, and between different settings.

The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or 'locked in' by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device.

Such an analyser has been constructed using concepts from work in artificial intelligence. A seismogram is recognized as a hierarchical structure of subunits and the features characterizing a phase are extracted via a structural analysis. The automatic analyser detects the onsets of phases, separates the relevant waveform segments, fits phase structures to standard wavelets, and generates a set of five parameters ( a quintuple') to characterize a detected phase. The whole analysis system requires just a few input parameters and can be accomplished swiftly enough to allow continuous real-time operation. The analysis procedure is adaptive, including updating of the estimate of the local frequency so that it can be applied to broad-band records with a wide range of frequency content. By coupling the analysis procedure with real-time filtering, very good results for phase detection and characterization can be achieved for weak distant events. The characterization of phase segments also provides useful information for the comparison of seismograms.},

abstract = {Patterns of neural data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) can be classified by machine learning techniques to increase human-system performance. In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50{\%} when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.},

abstract = {The amplitude and latency of single-trial EEG/MEG signals may provide valuable information concerning human brain functioning. In this article we propose a new method to reliably estimate single-trial amplitude and latency of EEG/MEG signals. The advantages of the method are fourfold. First, no a-priori specified template function is required. Second, the method allows for multiple signals that may vary independently in amplitude and/or latency. Third, the method is less sensitive to noise as it models data with a parsimonious set of basis functions. Finally, the method is very fast since it is based on an iterative linear least squares algorithm. A simulation study shows that the method yields reliable estimates under different levels of latency variation and signal-to-noise ratio{\~{O}}s. Furthermore, it shows that the existence of multiple signals can be correctly determined. An application to empirical data from a choice reaction time study indicates that the method describes these data accurately.},

abstract = {Objective: Designing a reliable and accurate brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the most challenging fields in biomedical signal processing. To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems' design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: "peak picking" and "template matching". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines. This research indicates that, using both spatial and temporal information content of EEG trials (from all electrodes or a subset of them), even under a non-complicated mathematical framework can yield an accurate and powerful classification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Electroencephalography (EEG) still remains one of the most useful and effective tools in understanding and treatment of epilepsy. To this end, many computational methods have been devel-oped for both the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. Techniques derived from linear/nonlinear analysis, chaos, information theory, morphological analysis, model-based analysis, all present different advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Recently, there is the notion of selecting and combining the most robust features from different methods for revealing various signals' characteristics and making more reliable assumptions. Finally, intelligent classifiers are employed in order to distinguish epileptic state out of normal states. This chapter reviews the most widely adopted algorithms for the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures, emphasizing on information theory based and entropy indices. Each method's accuracy has been evaluated through performance measures, assessing the ability of automatic seizure detection/ prediction.},

The performance of three methods was studied: peak picking, Woody's method, and Pham et al.'s method (as well as an extension of this latter method). Performance of all methods critically depended on the signal-to-noise ratio. There was some advantage for the more sophisticated methods, particularly when signal-to-noise ratios were realistic. "Good" trials may be selected by all methods, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but this selection entails the risk of bias.

abstract = {The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the world. Symptoms include progressive memory, cognitive and behavioural changes before death, caused by amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorated tau in the brain. The cause of AD is currently unknown and current interventions only slow the decline. Diagnosis is based on patient and familial history, interviews with close family and friends, cognitive, mental and physical tests. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the electrical signals of the brain, which AD, as a cortical dementia, is known to directly affect. Non-linear signal processing has shown that these changes in the EEG can be identified with complementary findings to linear methods. This thesis aimed to explore these changes with novel univariate and bivariate methods using both synthetic signals and resting, eyes-closed EEGs recorded from 22 subjects, 11 AD patients (MMSE=13.1±5.9 (mean SD)) and 11 age-matched controls (30±0). Permutation entropy showed statistically significant increased complexity in control EEGs for electrodes at the front of the head. Bivariate analysis was novel for this EEG database so coherence was used to create a comparison results set. With the success of Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), distance based bivariate forms were applied (dLZC03). Novel normalisation methods based on that for univariate LZC showed a greater representation of the signal patterns in the results. Volume conduction was shown to significantly impact the results, both of coherence and dLZC03, though this was greater with coherence. Lastly, volume conduction mitigated, bandwidth based pre filtering with dLZC03 was calculated, producing the most significant p values ever recorded with this EEG database. Thus this PhD shows increased distinction between the two subject groups with dLZC03 over LZC and increased distinction with limited but targeted bandwidths from those subject signals.},

abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are important research tools because they provide insights into mental processing at high temporal resolution. Their usefulness, however, is limited by the need to average over a large number of trials, sacrificing information about the trial-by-trial variability of latencies or amplitudes of specific ERP components. Here we propose a novel method based on an iteration strategy of the residues of averaged ERPs (RIDE) to separate latency-variable component clusters. The separated component clusters can then serve as templates to estimate latencies in single trials with high precision. By applying RIDE to data from a face-priming experiment, we separate priming effects and show that they are robust against latency shifts and within-condition variability. RIDE is useful for a variety of data sets that show different degrees of variability and temporal overlap between ERP components.},

abstract = {We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (TMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (???4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new relative measure of signal complexity, referred to here as relative structural complexity (RSC), which is based on the matching pursuit (MP) decomposition. By relative, we refer to the fact that this new measure is highly dependent on the decomposition dictionary used by MP. The structural part of the definition points to the fact that this new measure is related to the structure, or composition, of the signal under analysis. After a formal definition, the proposed RSC measure is used in the analysis of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, firstly, a time-frequency decomposition dictionary is specifically designed to compactly represent the newborn EEG seizure state using MP. We then show, through the analysis of synthetic and real newborn EEG data, that the relative structural complexity measure can indicate changes in EEG structure as it transitions between the two EEG states; namely seizure and background (non-seizure).},

abstract = {The proportion of signal elements embedded in noise needed to detect a signal is a standard tool for investigating motion perception. This paradigm was applied to the shape domain to determine how local information is pooled into a global percept. Stimulus arrays consisted of oriented Gabor elements that sampled the circumference of concentric radial frequency (RF) patterns. Individual Gabors were oriented tangentially to the shape (signal) or randomly (noise). In different conditions, signal elements were located randomly within the entire array or constrained to fall along one of the concentric contours. Coherence thresholds were measured for RF patterns with various frequencies (number of corners) and amplitudes ("sharpness" of corners). Coherence thresholds (about 10{\%} = 15 elements) were lowest for circular shapes. Manipulating shape frequency or amplitude showed a range where thresholds remain unaffected (frequency ≤ RF4; amplitude ≤ 0.05). Increasing either parameter caused thresholds to rise. Compared to circles, thresholds increased by approximately four times for RF13 and five times for amplitudes of 0.3. Confining the signals to individual contours significantly reduced the number of elements needed to reach threshold (between 4 and 6), independent of the total number of elements on the contour or contour shape. Finally, adding external noise to the orientation of the elements had a greater effect on detection thresholds than adding noise to their position. These results provide evidence for a series of highly sensitive, shape-specific analysers which sum information globally but only from within specific annuli. These global mechanisms are tuned to position and orientation of local elements from which they pool information. The overall performance for arrays of elements can be explained by the sensitivity of multiple, independent concentric shape detectors rather than a single detector integrating information widely across space (e.g. Glass pattern detector).},

Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 .

@book{WolpawJonathanR2012,
abstract = {In the last 15 years, a recognizable surge in the field of Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research and development has emerged. This emergence has sprung from a variety of factors. For one, inexpensive computer hardware and software is now available and can support the complex high-speed analyses of brain activity that is essential is BCI. Another factor is the greater understanding of the central nervous system including the abundance of new information on the nature and functional correlates of brain signals and improved methods for recording these signals in both the short-term and long-term. And the third, and perhaps most significant factor, is the new recognition of the needs and abilities of people disabled by disorders such as cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophies. The severely disabled are now able to live for many years and even those with severely limited voluntary muscle control can now be given the most basic means of communication and control because of the recent advances in the technology, research, and applications of BCI. This book is intended to provide an introduction to and summary of essentially all major aspects of BCI research and development. Its goal is to be a comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated presentation of the field's key principles, current practice, and future prospects.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art image classification methods require an intensive learning/training stage (using SVM, Boosting, etc.) In contrast, non-parametric nearest-neighbor (NN) based image classifiers require no training time and have other favorable properties. However, the large performance gap between these two families of approaches rendered NN-based image classifiers useless. We claim that the effectiveness of non-parametric NN-based image classification has been considerably undervalued. We argue that two practices commonly used in image classification methods, have led to the inferior performance of NN-based image classifiers: (i) Quantization of local image descriptors (used to generate "bags-of-words ", codebooks). (ii) Computation of 'image-to-image' distance, instead of 'image-to-class' distance. We propose a trivial NN-based classifier - NBNN, (Naive-Bayes nearest-neighbor), which employs NN- distances in the space of the local image descriptors (and not in the space of images). NBNN computes direct 'image- to-class' distances without descriptor quantization. We further show that under the Naive-Bayes assumption, the theoretically optimal image classifier can be accurately approximated by NBNN. Although NBNN is extremely simple, efficient, and requires no learning/training phase, its performance ranks among the top leading learning-based image classifiers. Empirical comparisons are shown on several challenging databases (Caltech-101 ,Caltech-256 and Graz-01).},

Eight people with ALS performed two behavioral tasks: (i) a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task, screening the temporal filtering capacity and the speed of the update of the attentive filter, and (ii) a change detection task, screening the memory capacity and the spatial filtering capacity. The participants were also asked to perform a P300-based BCI spelling task. By using correlation and regression analyses, we found that only the temporal filtering capacity in the RSVP task was a predictor of both the P300-based BCI accuracy and of the amplitude of the P300 elicited performing the BCI task. We concluded that the ability to keep the attentional filter active during the selection of a target influences performance in BCI control.},

abstract = {An EEG-based brain-computer system can be used to control external devices such as computers, wheelchairs or Virtual Environments. One of the most important applications is a spelling device to aid severely disabled individuals with communication, for example people disabled by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). P300-based BCI systems are optimal for spelling characters with high speed and accuracy, as compared to other BCI paradigms such as motor imagery. In this study, 100 subjects tested a P300-based BCI system to spell a 5-character word with only 5 min of training. EEG data were acquired while the subject looked at a 36-character matrix to spell the word WATER. Two different versions of the P300 speller were used: (i) the row/column speller (RC) that flashes an entire column or row of characters and (ii) a single character speller (SC) that flashes each character individually. The subjects were free to decide which version to test. Nineteen subjects opted to test both versions. The BCI system classifier was trained on the data collected for the word WATER. During the real-time phase of the experiment, the subject spelled the word LUCAS, and was provided with the classifier selection accuracy after each of the five letters. Additionally, subjects filled out a questionnaire about age, sex, education, sleep duration, working duration, cigarette consumption, coffee consumption, and level of disturbance that the flashing characters produced. 72.8{\%} (N = 81) of the subjects were able to spell with 100{\%} accuracy in the RC paradigm and 55.3{\%} (N = 38) of the subjects spelled with 100{\%} accuracy in the SC paradigm. Less than 3{\%} of the subjects did not spell any character correctly. People who slept less than 8 h performed significantly better than other subjects. Sex, education, working duration, and cigarette and coffee consumption were not statistically related to differences in accuracy. The disturbance of the flashing characters was rated with a median score of 1 on a scale from 1 to 5 (1, not disturbing; 5, highly disturbing). This study shows that high spelling accuracy can be achieved with the P300 BCI system using approximately 5 min of training data for a large number of non-disabled subjects, and that the RC paradigm is superior to the SC paradigm. 89{\%} of the 81 RC subjects were able to spell with accuracy 80-100{\%}. A similar study using a motor imagery BCI with 99 subjects showed that only 19{\%} of the subjects were able to achieve accuracy of 80-100{\%}. These large differences in accuracy suggest that with limited amounts of training data the P300-based BCI is superior to the motor imagery BCI. Overall, these results are very encouraging and a similar study should be conducted with subjects who have ALS to determine if their accuracy levels are similar. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

It can be used as a novel tool in easy setup clinical routines, to improve the rehabilitation process by mean of detecting patient´s motor intention, performing it by FES and finally receiving appropriate feedback The BCI-FES system presented here, consists of three blocks: the first one decodes the patient´s intention and it is composed by the patient, the acquisition hardware and the processing software (Emotiv EPOC{\textregistered}). The second block, based on Arduino's technology, transforms the information into a valid command signal. The last one excites the patient´s neuromuscular system by means of a FES device. In order to evaluate the cerebral activity sensed by the device, topographic maps were obtained. The BCI-FES system was able to detect the patient´s motor intention and control the FES device. At the time of this publication, the system it's being employing in a rehabilitation program with patients post stroke.},

We selected two women (who were breastfeeding), one without and one with breast engorgement. Then, we compare the different patterns of engorgement, temperature and tolerance to painful pressure before and after treatment, which consisted of massage and manual milking. Initial measurements indicated that normal puerperal breasts were cooler than ingurgitated breasts; also it was found that the normal breasts were more tolerant to pain pressure. After treatment, the engorged breasts have their temperature reduced and also represented more tolerance to pain. The technologies applied, although with some limitations, have provided preliminary important information, which combined with the clinical examination showed different patterns of breast engorgement, temperature and tolerance to pain, comparing the events before and after treatment.},

abstract = {"This edition has several new features, reflective of the changes that have occurred in our field over the last 5 years since the fifth edition. More and more, the field of digital recording has expanded; however, in order to understand some of the shortcomings and pitfalls of digital EEG, people need to still address the issues of basic analog recording principles. With an increased use of digital recording, laboratories have collected new and different "technical artifacts." We present here an attempt to start a database for such artifacts in a hopes that future editions will continue to expand upon this and offer a fairly complete library for beginning individuals interested in our field. As noted in the fifth edition, epilepsy monitoring units (EMU's) have continued to mushroom. Similar growth has occurred in the use of EEG monitoring in newborn, cardiac, trauma, and post-operative intensive care units. With the significant advances in wireless communication and easy access to the Internet, such recordings can also be viewed and transmitted locally virtually instantaneously and can allow for well-trained clinical neurophysiologists to see and opine about patients' conditions on a very time-relevant basis. Hopefully, as future generations may show, this ability will significantly influence our patients' outcomes. Similarly, the field of intraoperative clinical neurophysiology for spinal cord function, cranial nerve function, and cranial vascular therapies has continued to evolve along with the wireless and iInternet communications. This has allowed for close monitoring of neurologic function during critical periods of operations, again with a time course that allows for corrective actions to be taken on a meaningful time frame"-Provided by publisher.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study if an electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can be treated as a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG). We approach this problem by calculating the frequency of both healthy and epileptic EEG signals, and we find that all EEG signals obey the Gaussian distribution with different standard deviations. However, under some transformation, we can treat EEG signals as PRNGs. Our transformation takes the sum of the least significant five bits of the EEG sample amplitude and then outputs the parity of this sum to a binary (0 or 1) sequence. Our binary sequences have passed nearly all NIST pseudo-random number tests except a few failures. This indicates that the EEG signals can indeed become a PRNG provided that it undergoes a transformation like ours. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, we present a calibration algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the shape-feature vector, the number of trials, and the electrodes needed by a Brain Computer Interface to accurately detect P300s; we also define a method to find a template that best represents, for a given electrode, the subject's P300 based on his/her own acquired signals. Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector. The shape-feature vector is 34-dimensional for every electrode; however, it is possible to significantly reduce its dimensionality while keeping a high sensitivity. The validation of the calibration algorithm showed an averaged area under the ROC (AUROC) curve of 0.88 . Also, most of the subjects needed less than 15 trials to have an AUROC superior to 0.8 . Finally, we found that the electrode C4 also leads to better classification.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the world. Symptoms include progressive memory, cognitive and behavioural changes before death, caused by amyloid plaques and hyperphosphorated tau in the brain. The cause of AD is currently unknown and current interventions only slow the decline. Diagnosis is based on patient and familial history, interviews with close family and friends, cognitive, mental and physical tests. The electroencephalogram (EEG) records the electrical signals of the brain, which AD, as a cortical dementia, is known to directly affect. Non-linear signal processing has shown that these changes in the EEG can be identified with complementary findings to linear methods. This thesis aimed to explore these changes with novel univariate and bivariate methods using both synthetic signals and resting, eyes-closed EEGs recorded from 22 subjects, 11 AD patients (MMSE=13.1±5.9 (mean SD)) and 11 age-matched controls (30±0). Permutation entropy showed statistically significant increased complexity in control EEGs for electrodes at the front of the head. Bivariate analysis was novel for this EEG database so coherence was used to create a comparison results set. With the success of Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC), distance based bivariate forms were applied (dLZC03). Novel normalisation methods based on that for univariate LZC showed a greater representation of the signal patterns in the results. Volume conduction was shown to significantly impact the results, both of coherence and dLZC03, though this was greater with coherence. Lastly, volume conduction mitigated, bandwidth based pre filtering with dLZC03 was calculated, producing the most significant p values ever recorded with this EEG database. Thus this PhD shows increased distinction between the two subject groups with dLZC03 over LZC and increased distinction with limited but targeted bandwidths from those subject signals.},

abstract = {Patterns of neural data obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) can be classified by machine learning techniques to increase human-system performance. In controlled laboratory settings this classification approach works well; however, transitioning these approaches into more dynamic, unconstrained environments will present several significant challenges. One such challenge is an increase in temporal variability in measured behavioral and neural responses, which often results in suboptimal classification performance. Previously, we reported a novel classification method designed to account for temporal variability in the neural response in order to improve classification performance by using sliding windows in hierarchical discriminant component analysis (HDCA), and demonstrated a decrease in classification error by over 50{\%} when compared to the standard HDCA method (Marathe et al., 2013). Here, we expand upon this approach and show that embedded within this new method is a novel signal transformation that, when applied to EEG signals, significantly improves the signal-to-noise ratio and thereby enables more accurate single-trial analysis. The results presented here have significant implications for both brain-computer interaction technologies and basic science research into neural processes.},

abstract = {We present a new paradigm for the adaptive estimation of evoked brain responses in single trials, based upon the combination of the matching pursuit (MP) algorithm and template matching, and referred to as Template Matching Pursuit (TMP). In contrast to the classical template matching with invariant single-trial morphology and to previous approaches using MP with strong similarity constraint on functions in sequential trials, this adaptive approach allows for a wide variety of waveforms, and its universality is retained by parametrizing all relevant waveforms in terms of Gabor functions. A survey of single-trial estimates obtained for 10 subjects (???4000 individual trials in total) confirms the validity of the assumption of a good approximation of single-trial waveforms. Owing to the fully parametric approach, we can easily perform also any quantitative analysis of such a huge dataset. As an example we take the trial-to-trial variability of the peak amplitude and latency of the auditory M100 component. This methodology provides estimates of diversified morphologies, which makes it free from the limitations inherent to any restrictive model. This seems advantageous in the context of the ongoing debate as to the neural mechanisms of average evoked brain responses. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) are important research tools because they provide insights into mental processing at high temporal resolution. Their usefulness, however, is limited by the need to average over a large number of trials, sacrificing information about the trial-by-trial variability of latencies or amplitudes of specific ERP components. Here we propose a novel method based on an iteration strategy of the residues of averaged ERPs (RIDE) to separate latency-variable component clusters. The separated component clusters can then serve as templates to estimate latencies in single trials with high precision. By applying RIDE to data from a face-priming experiment, we separate priming effects and show that they are robust against latency shifts and within-condition variability. RIDE is useful for a variety of data sets that show different degrees of variability and temporal overlap between ERP components.},

By relative, we refer to the fact that this new measure is highly dependent on the decomposition dictionary used by MP. The structural part of the definition points to the fact that this new measure is related to the structure, or composition, of the signal under analysis. After a formal definition, the proposed RSC measure is used in the analysis of newborn electroencephalogram (EEG). To do this, firstly, a time-frequency decomposition dictionary is specifically designed to compactly represent the newborn EEG seizure state using MP. We then show, through the analysis of synthetic and real newborn EEG data, that the relative structural complexity measure can indicate changes in EEG structure as it transitions between the two EEG states; namely seizure and background (non-seizure).},

abstract = {Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological diseases and the most common neurological chronic disease in childhood. Electroencephalography (EEG) still remains one of the most useful and effective tools in understanding and treatment of epilepsy. To this end, many computational methods have been devel-oped for both the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures. Techniques derived from linear/nonlinear analysis, chaos, information theory, morphological analysis, model-based analysis, all present different advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Recently, there is the notion of selecting and combining the most robust features from different methods for revealing various signals' characteristics and making more reliable assumptions. Finally, intelligent classifiers are employed in order to distinguish epileptic state out of normal states. This chapter reviews the most widely adopted algorithms for the detection and prediction of epileptic seizures, emphasizing on information theory based and entropy indices. Each method's accuracy has been evaluated through performance measures, assessing the ability of automatic seizure detection/ prediction.},

abstract = {Objective: Designing a reliable and accurate brain-computer interface (BCI) is one of the most challenging fields in biomedical signal processing. To achieve this goal, different methods have been adopted in different blocks of a typical BCI system (i.e., in preprocessing, feature extraction, feature classification and feature selection blocks). Since BCI's speed plays a crucial role in its success in real-life applications, using mathematically simple techniques with accurate and reliable performance can improve this aspect of BCI systems' design. Methods and materials: In this paper, a new method is introduced, which combines information from different classic time series similarity measures, using a simple fuzzy fusion framework. This method is accurate and reliable in P300 (a positive event-related component occurring 300 ms after stimulus onset) detection. This framework is used to combine two computationally simple signal detection methods: "peak picking" and "template matching". Fusion takes place in the last step (decision-making step) by means of a fuzzy rule-base. Results and conclusions: Compared to similar works on electroencephalogram-based (EEG-based) BCI datasets, in spite of being computationally simple, this new technique's performance is comparable to very complicated methods, like support vector machines. This research indicates that, using both spatial and temporal information content of EEG trials (from all electrodes or a subset of them), even under a non-complicated mathematical framework can yield an accurate and powerful classification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The amplitude and latency of single-trial EEG/MEG signals may provide valuable information concerning human brain functioning. In this article we propose a new method to reliably estimate single-trial amplitude and latency of EEG/MEG signals. The advantages of the method are fourfold. First, no a-priori specified template function is required. Second, the method allows for multiple signals that may vary independently in amplitude and/or latency. Third, the method is less sensitive to noise as it models data with a parsimonious set of basis functions. Finally, the method is very fast since it is based on an iterative linear least squares algorithm. A simulation study shows that the method yields reliable estimates under different levels of latency variation and signal-to-noise ratio{\~{O}}s. Furthermore, it shows that the existence of multiple signals can be correctly determined. An application to empirical data from a choice reaction time study indicates that the method describes these data accurately.},

abstract = {The intra-subject variability (ISV) in brain responses during cognitive processing across experimental trials has been recognised as an important facet of neural functionality reflecting an intrinsic neurophysiological characteristic of the brain. In recent decades, ISV in behaviour has been found to be significantly associated with cognitive functioning varying across individuals, development, ages, and pathological conditions. Event-related potentials (ERPs) measured in single trials are important tools for characterizing ISV at the neural level. However, due to the overlapping spectra of noise and signals, the retrieval of information from single-trial ERPs related to cognitive processing has been a challenge. We review the major problems that researchers face in the estimation of ISV in single-trial ERPs. Then, we present an extensive evaluation of several methods of single-trial latency estimation based on both simulated and real data. The relationships of ISV in ERPs and reaction times are compared between the different single-trial methods to assess their relative efficiency in predicting task performance from neural signals. The pros and cons of the methods are discussed.},

We developed a method based on dynamic time warping (DTW). The method was applied to ERPs recorded from normal and dyslexic children during two reading tasks. We found that characteristic latency and amplitude changes of ERP components are due to task and pathology. Our results support the idea that dyslexia involves different and complex cerebral functions aside from the language system. This mathematical approach provides reproducible analysis criteria that are crucial for the reliability of ERP analysis.},

@article{ChandranKS2016,
abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

In "pseudo-real" simulations of the N1-P2 complex of the occipital visual-evoked potential, M{\"{o}}cks, K{\"{o}}hler, Gasser, and Pham (1988) had reported that their maximum-likelihood method (Pham, M{\"{o}}cks, K{\"{o}}hler, {\&} Gasser, 1987) performed better than Woody's (1967) method. Using pseudo-real simulations of auditory oddball data, we wanted to know whether this finding also held true for the P3 complex. The performance of three methods was studied: peak picking, Woody's method, and Pham et al.'s method (as well as an extension of this latter method). Performance of all methods critically depended on the signal-to-noise ratio. There was some advantage for the more sophisticated methods, particularly when signal-to-noise ratios were realistic. "Good" trials may be selected by all methods, to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but this selection entails the risk of bias. Further research should investigate whether these conclusions also hold true when the P3 complex consists of more than one component.},

@article{Schmidtmann2013,
abstract = {The proportion of signal elements embedded in noise needed to detect a signal is a standard tool for investigating motion perception. This paradigm was applied to the shape domain to determine how local information is pooled into a global percept. Stimulus arrays consisted of oriented Gabor elements that sampled the circumference of concentric radial frequency (RF) patterns. Individual Gabors were oriented tangentially to the shape (signal) or randomly (noise). In different conditions, signal elements were located randomly within the entire array or constrained to fall along one of the concentric contours. Coherence thresholds were measured for RF patterns with various frequencies (number of corners) and amplitudes ("sharpness" of corners). Coherence thresholds (about 10{\%} = 15 elements) were lowest for circular shapes. Manipulating shape frequency or amplitude showed a range where thresholds remain unaffected (frequency ≤ RF4; amplitude ≤ 0.05). Increasing either parameter caused thresholds to rise. Compared to circles, thresholds increased by approximately four times for RF13 and five times for amplitudes of 0.3. Confining the signals to individual contours significantly reduced the number of elements needed to reach threshold (between 4 and 6), independent of the total number of elements on the contour or contour shape. Finally, adding external noise to the orientation of the elements had a greater effect on detection thresholds than adding noise to their position. These results provide evidence for a series of highly sensitive, shape-specific analysers which sum information globally but only from within specific annuli. These global mechanisms are tuned to position and orientation of local elements from which they pool information. The overall performance for arrays of elements can be explained by the sensitivity of multiple, independent concentric shape detectors rather than a single detector integrating information widely across space (e.g. Glass pattern detector).},

Our experiments with 21 subjects showed that the SWLDA's performance using our shape-feature vector was 93 {\%} , that is, 10 {\%} higher than the one obtained with BCI2000-feature's vector.
