\section*{\fbox{Reviewer \#1 Transcript:}}

The paper is an interesting research paper and presents an analysis of the P300 ERP. The authors provide a literature review of the current methods used to detect EEG patterns and conduct three experiments to identify the P300 ERP in EEG recordings. The paper is well-organized. The paper should incorporate the following comments before its acceptance for publication:

 

1. The major concern is that the experiments have been conducted with only one participant. The authors should collect more data in this study. In other studies cited in the paper by authors,  two and 16 participants were recruited.

 

2. It is strongly recommended that the authors should re-check some paragraphs of the manuscript, correct any grammatical and syntactic errors and improve the scientific language. In some cases, it was hard to follow the meaning. (e.g. Page 2, Paragraph 4, Line 51-54, Page 11, Paragraph 3, Line 343-345)

 

3. In the Introduction section the authors refer to BCI applications; however, no scientific studies are reported. Also, the literature section should be revised with recent publication. Below are some scientific studies that is suggested to be included for BCI applications:

4. In the literature section, Table I briefly presents the proposed methods followed by other authors; however, there is no text describing the table. The authors should include a paragraph describing each method and the recent findings concisely, in order to present better the literature review.

6. The Results section is not well-presented. The authors are advised to include a paragraph before Table 2, Table 3 and Fig. 6-8 presenting the obtained results (best/worst channel performance and algorithm performance for each experiment) and then discuss the results in the Discussion section. Please revise excessive descriptions in the captions of Table 2, Table 3 and Fig. 6-8.

 

7. “the obtained character identification rate is above theoretical chance level, and for some algorithms close to the usable threshold of 70\%” (Page 19, Paragraph 2, Line 465-466) What is the obtained character identification rate in other scientific studies? Is the obtained result (70\%) of this study comparable to others?

 

8. In the Discussion section a table presenting the statistical analysis results would present better the results and would facilitate the reader.

The authors provide a literature review of the current methods used to detect EEG patterns and conduct three experiments to identify the P300 ERP in EEG recordings. The paper is well-organized.

We have now included more participants to this experiment and it was divided in two modalities.  The first, which is now called passive-modality, includes now 4 subjects.  The second, an active-modality, now includes 4 more participants who were engaged in a copy-spelling task on a P300-Based BCI Speller.   For this subjects, the pseudo-real dataset is constructed by superimposed a P300 template obtained for each subject into segments marked as hit.  The baseline for each segment is constructed from a random no-hit segment for the same subject.

The reported binary classification accuracy for this BCI Competition was around 95\%. However in this case, as we are emphasizing the waveforms of the signals, the classification uses only single-channel activity, which is less information.  Regardless of this, the obtained results for some of the algorithms can be used to implement usable P300-Based Speller applications due to the usage of word predictive schemes.
